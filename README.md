# Instagram Follower Scraper
First program on GitHub, using inspiration from others on this site, designed to find the list of people who have yet to follow you, even though you have them followed :(

To use:
  Have to have Python downloaded
  Have to have Instaloader and Numpy modules downloaded (I personally downloaded it by going on newest Pycharm version and "Python packages"
  
Should work, but it might show an error for Two-Factor verification if your account has it so you have to go into Meta Account Center and turn it off for a brief amount of time until the program finishes running.

Have fun :)
